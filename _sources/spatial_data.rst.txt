Loading Data into QGIS
========================

In GIS, spatial data refers to the points, lines, and area features that are drawn on maps to represent the geographic location of natural and human phenomena, such as mountains, rivers, roads, bridges, homicides, etc.  In general, spatial data is any data that can be mapped. 

The points, lines and polygons that represent map features can be drawn using precise coordinates (vector data) or they can be represented by one or more contiguous grid cells (raster data).  Popular vector products include shapefiles and geodatabases, which are sets of files used to represents points, lines, and polygons. Popular raster products include digital elevation models, satellite imagery, thematic rasters, orthophotos, and digital topographic maps. 

With desktop GIS, we can load the spatial data types mentioned above into the software in their original format. With webâ€“based GIS platforms, the data types must be converted to web-based formats. ArcGIS Online can handle a surprisingly large number of spatial data formats. 

First of all, at startup, the software provides access to several web maps in the form of global base maps including Google map, Bing Map, and Open Street Map.  The default basemap is a topographic map, but, depending on the nature of your project, you can change this to any one of the available basemaps.
