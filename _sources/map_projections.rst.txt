Map Projections
=======================================
In this Module, we will examine how to work with map projections in ArcGIS Online.   This is a key topic with respect to handling spatial data.   All map layers have been projected from a sphere or ellipsoid onto a flat surface.  These projections, regardless of their goal, always cause features on the map to take on distinctive shapes, or they may distort area, distance and direction calculations. 

Although all map layers have inherent geometric errors caused by their projection, the good news is that depending on the projection, some of these errors can be minimized.  For this reason, GIS users are very careful when selecting a projection for their map.  

As a rule, you should always select a projection based on the needs of your project.  If you are embarking on a project where you have to constantly measure the size of places, you should select an equal area projection, as these projections seek to minimize errors relating to the size of places. Likewise, if you wish to constantly measure distances accurately, select an equidistant projection. If measuring directions is important in your project, then select a conformal projection.
