Getting Started
================== 



Launching QGIS 
===============
1. To launch QGIS on Macs, click Finder | Application | QGIS. 
On Windows, click: Start | All Programs |  QGIS | QGIS. 
 


2. At start-up the program may appear as shown below. Note: there may be a slight difference depending on how your computer is configured. 
 



 
 
Displaying Map Layers in QGIS
==============================

1. To load a map layer into QGIS, click the Layer button on the main menu, then click Add Vector Layer | Add Vector button. 
 

 
 
2. Click on the drop-down at the left of the Vector Dataset(s) textbox, browse to the folder where the data is loaded, and select the USA_States.shp file (Make sure it not the XML file).  Click Add to add the layer to the map then close the data source manage dialog.  If you are prompted for Coordinate Systems Information, enter WGS 84 for the coordinates.

 
3. The map layer will be added to QGIS.


 

4. If the Layers panel to the right is not visible, click on View  | Panels | Layers. The panel will be added. You may have to move panels that are blocking its view. Layer Panel
 


 
Viewing the Attribute Table

1. To view the attribute table of the streets layer, right click on the name of the layer and select Open Attribute table. Inspect the attribute table.

 
 
2. Notice the names of each state in the attribute table. If you select the record or row for a state, the state will be highlighted on the map.  Try it and see for yourself.  It is one of the features that make GIS software special.

 
3. Investigate the numerous columns in the attribute table. Each column contains data about the characteristics of each state's population.  Looking at the numbers in each column, you may eventually see a pattern, but it takes time. To quickly visualize geographic patterns, we can map the numbers.  Let's map the data in the population column.
 




Mapping Data Stored in the Attribute Table


1. To map the data in any column of the attribute table of a vector map layer, we have to first close the attribute table.
 
2. Now, right click on the layer name again and choose ‘Properties’.

3. When the layer properties dialog opens, select the  "Symbology" tab to the left of the dialog.

4. Click on the drop-down button at the top right of the Symbology dialog and you will see several options, e.g., Single Symbol, Categorized, Graduated, Rule Based, etc.

The graduated style is used when you want to map columns in which the data are numerical quantities.  The graduated scheme will create choropleth maps, i.e., maps in which varying colors are used to represent different sized quantities.
Categorized is used when the values in the columns refer to categories of information, e.g. Democrats = 1, Republicans = 2, Independents = 3.  In this case, the numbers 1,2, and 3 are not quantities, but categories.
 

5. To map the population column, select Graduated as the Style.  Select Population as the column to map. Click on the dropdown next to Color Ramp and select also a color ramp. For numerical data that goes from lower values to higher values, one can select a single color.  Lower values will be given a lighter version of the color while higher values will be given a darker version of the color.

 
6. Select the default 5 as the number of classes. Next to mode, select natural breaks as the method of classification.  Click Classify.  Since we selected five classes, QGIS will place the life expectancy values of the 165 countries into 5 groups.
Natural breaks is a method of grouping the data. You can also experiment with equal interval, standard deviation, etc. to see their effect.   Natural breaks means that the software will rank the data from highest to lowest and then create five groups such that each group contains numbers that are generally similar to each other. The goal is to create groupings of similar numbers rather than groups of equal number of cases.   
 
7. Click OK and see the map in the main QGIS window. This map definitely conveys a lot more useful information that just numbers in a table.  

 
The steps outlined above show how to create a basic choropleth map in QGIS.  You should also take a look at the video below for a brief description of the process. 
 
 


 
Preparing maps for printing in QGIS

1. Now that you are done creating the map, the final step is "compose" the map to give it a professional touch.  QGIS comes an application called "Composer" that is used to  create professional quality maps.  Key components of a professional map include:
	•	The map body
	•	The title of the map 
	•	The scale bar
	•	The north arrow  
	•	The legend 
	•	Data Source (optional)
 
 
2. With the map you are working on still opened in QGIS,  click on Project on the main menu, then ‘New Print Layout.  

 
 
3. Enter a name for the new print composer object that will be created, e.g., "USA_Population Distribution Layout". A new print Composer window will open. The Print Composer tool contains four main parts(1) a menu at the top of the screen, (2) a toolbar to the left, (3) the main map area, which has blank canvas where you would be composing the map, and (4) a panel with three tabs to the right, Composition, Item Properties, and Guides.
 

 
 
4.  To add a map to composer, click on Add Item on the main menu, then click "Add Map".  Now draw a rectangle container on the canvas to hold the map.  When you end the rectangle, the map will appear.  Note: If you do not like the rectangle size, you can always resize it afterwards.
 

 
5. If you wanted to enlarge the map and show only the contiguous states, then go back to the map area, and enlarge the view there. You may have to delete the rectangle and redraw it.
 
6.  Click inside the box and drag the map container until it is centered on the page. 
 
7. To add a scalebar, click on Add Item on the main menu, then select "Add Scalebar".  Draw a rectangle on the composition where you want to place the scale bar then release. The scalebar will appear. Resize the scalebar to suit your taste.
 
8. With the scalebar selected, click on "Item Properties" to the right of the composer. Here you can fiddle with the different values to adjust elements of the scalebar's appearance.
 
9.  Repeat the same process as described in 8 above to add north arrow and legend to your map. Title and other text are added with the "Add Label" button on the Toolbar to the left.  Here is an illustration of my completed map.
 
 
10. Once you are satisfied with the map, you can export it as Image, PDF or SVG. For this tutorial, let’s export it as a PNG image. Click onLayout | Export as Image.  Select a path and a name for the exported image.  This image can be uploaded to Canvas Dropbox.
 
11. Creating attractive maps requires knowledge about map design and map communication principles.  There is a large body of literature on elements of good map design. In Module 1.6,  I present some basic maps design ideas.  Please read these design ideas and try to integrate them as much as possible into your own map design. 
 
12. As a rule, always try to create beautiful maps that effectively communicate spatial information. Conversely, always try to avoid creating ugly maps that fail to effectively communicate useful information.
